						<div class = "panel-body">
							I work for Harvard Kennedy School as the Program Assistant for the Master in International Development program. Prior to taking my current job in November 2013, I was on a research fellowship in Kyoto, Japan, where I was exploring and practicing tea ceremony. I graduated from Amherst College in 2012 with a BA in Religion. I know a little Japanese, love Legos and computers, and enjoy running and hiking!

						</div>
						<div class = "panel-body">
							I am taking Dynamic Web Applications because I enjoy computer science and have not had a chance to study it in a classroom setting since college. I am considering entering a Post-Bac CS Program as a pre-Master's option. Web development is an area I have not really explored, so I'm quite excited for this course.

							<h3 class = "panel-title"> HTML/CSS Experience </h3>
						</div>
						<div class = "panel-body">
							My only classroom experience with HTML and CSS is from early high school -- and it was mostly through Dreamweaver, so it may not even count. I've taught myself enough to make rather ugly and static web pages, but nothing more. Even creating this page has been a learning experience.

						</div>
						<div class = "panel-body">
							In high school, I took AP Computer Science and had a great time learning the ins and outs of Java. I continued with Java in college. 	Recently, I've been learning Ruby, ROR, and MySQL through Code Academy and as a part of an EdX course on Sabermetrics. I have never worked with PHP!

							I use both a Mac and PC to do work for this course. The Mac is running OSX and the PC is running Windows 8. I prefer the Mac for ease of use, but the PC has a nice big screen that's great for programming.
